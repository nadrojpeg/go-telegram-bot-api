A Go wrapper for the Telegram Bot API  
I'm currently reading _The Go Programming Language_. I started this project as my first Go project, and it is a work in progress. I work on this wrapper in my spare time, so I don't know when it will be ready for a real-world project.  
As this is my first Go project and I'm still learning, the library may not currently adhere to all idiomatic Go conventions. I'm actively reading existing Go code to improve my style and will refactor this project accordingly as I learn.
